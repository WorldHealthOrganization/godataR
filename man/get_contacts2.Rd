\usage{
get_contacts2(
  url = url,

\arguments{
\item{url}{Insert the base URL for your instance of Go.Data here. Don't forget the forward slash "/" at end!}

\item{username}{The email address for your Go.Data login.}

\item{password}{The password for your Go.Data login}

\item{outbreak_id}{The id number for the outbreak for which you want to download contacts}

\item{wait}{The number of seconds to wait in between iterations of checking the status of the download. Default is 5 seconds, but the user can specify a smaller value to speed up the process if the dataset is small.}

\item{file.type}{Whether the API should return a data structure with nested fields (json, the default) or an entirely flat data structure (csv)}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of contacts.
}
\description{
A function to retrieve the contact data for a
specific \code{outbreak_id}. This function relies
on the \verb{/outbreaks/\{id\}/contacts/export} API
endpoint.
}
\details{
If \code{file.type="json"}, then some fields, such as addresses, hospitalization history, and questionnaire fields may require further unnesting. See the \code{tidyr::unnest()} function.

If \code{file.type="csv"}, then all fields will be unnested resulting in a greater number of fields.
